# 🔮 🗡 Blades in the Dark – Progress Clock Shiny App 🕒 🕒 

A lightweight, interactive [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) web app for managing **Progress Clocks** in the tabletop RPG [Blades in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/).

Clocks are a narrative mechanic used to track progress, danger, and time pressure. This app makes them **visual, interactive, and customizable** for online or in-person play.

## 🎲 Why Progress Clocks?

Blades in the Dark uses progress clocks to escalate tension and track time-bound challenges. This tool makes them visible, trackable, and elegant for digital play.
